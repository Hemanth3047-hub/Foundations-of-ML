we have created a Kaggle challenge named “Is the driver at fault?” exclusively for you.
Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/t/53d1fd0d4cc8422bbdf9de2ea61f7e81.
This challenge is designed based on the Driver Accident  tabular Dataset which is provided in the link.
Kaggle is a crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems. 

A driver is at fault or no fault based on several direct and indirect variables specific to the accident and beyond.
The dataset has 42 features and almost all of them are categorical.
Your aim is to train an ML algorithm that optimizes the evaluation metric i.e Accuracy.
Train.csv file has the training data with Fault Label and input features. Test.csv file has unlabeled data.
The detailed description of the challenge and dataset can be found in the aforementioned link. 

Kaggle evaluates each submission on a held out validation set at the moment, which defines the current leaderboard.
Once you submit your solution, you will get a score and a rank (based on the held out validation set) on the public leaderboard.
At the end of the challenge, the final model(s) selected by you will be evaluated on the test set, and your entry is scored based on its performance on this test set.
Keep in mind that being a topper on the public leaderboard doesn’t guarantee you the same on the private leaderboard.
